> Extra Information And Resources

'Robert' is built around and using the source code from the [basicBot](https://github.com/basicBot/source) repo.

Thanks for the [Plug Community Documentation](https://github.com/plugcommunity/documentation) for giving me help in understands the API of plug.dj.

Used information from [plug.dj Bot Documentation](https://github.com/plugcommunity/documentation/blob/master/bots/README.md) without it, I would still be be stuck working out Role variables.

A lot of the commands available (and in development) have been inspired by multiple plug.dj rooms.

A detailed overview of the possible bot settings can be found in the [source repo](https://github.com/basicBot/custom/blob/master/settingsOverview.md).
