## Extra Information and Resources

Robert is built around and using the source code from the [basicBot](https://github.com/basicBot/source) repo. Thanks for the [Plug Community Documentation](https://github.com/plugcommunity/documentation) for giving me help in understands the API of plug.dj. Used information from [plug.dj Bot Documentation](https://github.com/plugcommunity/documentation/blob/master/bots/README.md) without it, I would still be be stuck working out Role variables. A lot of the commands available (and in development) have been inspired by multiple plug.dj rooms. A detailed overview of the possible bot settings can be found in the [source repo](https://github.com/basicBot/custom/blob/master/settingsOverview.md).
